# 🌲🔥 Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning

This project aims to detect forest fires automatically from images using a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. With increasing wildfire incidents due to climate change, early detection is critical. This deep learning–based solution provides a fast, scalable, and intelligent way to predict fire outbreaks from visual data.

## 📌 Project Overview

Forest fires are among the most devastating natural disasters, threatening the environment, wildlife, and human settlements. Manual monitoring methods like satellite imagery and ground patrols are slow and resource-intensive. This project presents a deep learning-powered image classification system that can detect forest fires from images with high accuracy and deploys it as an interactive web application using **Streamlit**.

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically classifies images as **Fire** or **No Fire**
- Achieves **83% accuracy** on the test dataset
- Integrated with **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface
- Allows users to:
  - Upload custom images
  - View real-time predictions and confidence scores
  - Hear alert sounds for detected fires
  - Download prediction results as reports
  - Experience UI enhancements with animation (via `streamlit-lottie`)
